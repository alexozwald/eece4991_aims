It can be used to measure the magnetic near-field strength from RF magnetic sources or electronic devices for EMI conformance test. The operating frequency of the probe is from 1 GHz up to 20 GHz. The probe is constructed based on a coplanar waveguide and stripline with a short-end loop. The probe dimension is 10 mm × 25 mm × 0.6 mm. The prototype probe is electric field-shield structure and has a very high unwanted electric field suppression ratio about 17.7 dB. The probe calibration factor from the simulation agrees well with the calibration factor computed from the measurement. The average probe factor is 38.8 dBS/m and probe sensitivity is 47.4 dB μA/m.},

	abstract = {A novel three dimensional (3D) antenna is designed for 24 GHz frequency ISM band applications. The 3D antenna uses optimal 2D space and relies heavily on 3D structures to provide improved antenna performance. Four different 3D antenna configurations are studied to understand the improvement in the antenna design. The antenna parameters and surface current distribution are compared with patch antenna of 24 GHz frequency. The 3D configuration allows more space for device fabrication and enhance the chip functionalities. The 3D architecture consist of antenna, which is fed by quarter wave transmission line to match antenna impedance. A wave port is designed to characterize the antenna. The designed 3D antenna is compact as compared to 2D planar patch antenna of same frequency. In the 3D architecture, the current is distributed to the patch on a different plane via 3D conducting channels. The current distribution shows maximum current in the surface conducting layer for two types of the 3D antenna designed. The compact 3D antenna is designed to radiate at 24 GHz and occupies space of less than 3.75 mm × 3.75 mm in the die as compared to the space of 7.27 mm × 7.27 mm for planar patch antenna of similar frequency. The reduction in space offers wide advantages in designing on-chip RF systems. The simulation of the antennas were completed using An soft HFSS™, 3D electromagnetic tool.},

By vertically stacking metal layers in a 3D printed single substrate, the designed antenna prototype exhibits the advantages of wide bandwidth and ultra-low profile. For proof-of-concept, multi-layer linear polarization (LP) patch antenna elements and 2 × 2 LP antenna arrays are designed, fabricated, and measured. It verifies that the feeding network can be integrated into the same substrate of the antenna array element without increasing the size and profile of the array. Compared with the traditional single-layer LP patch antenna, the proposed LP patch antenna can improve the impedance bandwidth from 5.9\% to 10.6\% (three layers) and 83\% (seven layers), respectively. All these designs can be fabricated in a single substrate with a thickness of 1.5 mm (0.031 λg), which is an ideal solution for the applications where ultra-low profile and wideband patch antenna are expected. Finally, circular polarization (CP) patch antenna elements and 2 × 2 CP antenna arrays are fabricated and measured. Good agreements between the simulated and the measured results verify that wider impedance bandwidth and broader frequency range of under 3-dB axial ratio can be obtained by vertically stacking metal layers. The antennas are designed at sub-6GHz, which have great potentials for 5G consumer mobile electronics.},

	abstract = {Submillimeter-scale domains offer wide-ranging benefits for chemical and biological fields, which have motivated researchers to develop a diversity of strategies for manufacturing integrated microfluidic systems. Historically, microfluidic device construction has predominantly relied on micromachining technologies that are rooted in the semiconductor and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) industries. These methodologies have enabled microfluidic platforms to be fabricated with fully integrated microelectronics – a critical requirement for applications such as electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis (DEP), surface acoustic wave (SAW) actuation, digital microfluidics (e.g., via electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) phenomena), and on-chip electrochemical detection. Despite the distinguishing capabilities afforded by conventional microfabrication protocols, a number of inherent limitations have given rise to increasing interest in alternative approaches for microdevice construction in the form of additive manufacturing or “three-dimensional (3D) printing”. Here we review recent progress in the development of both 3D printed microfluidics and 3D printed microelectronics. We evaluate the distinctive benefits and constraints associated with emerging 3D printing technologies with respect to the fabrication of both microfluidic and microelectronic systems. Lastly, we examine the potential use of 3D printing-based approaches for manufacturing microfluidic devices with integrated microelectronics.},

Whereas some of the current sensing techniques rise with the new principles, for example Hall-effect sensors and fluxgate sensor or advanced technologies such as magneto resistance effect sensing and fiber-optic techniques which provide alternatives in current sensing, almost at affordable price than traditional techniques just like shunt resistors. In addition to this, the system will be modified with transmitter block and receiver block which are connected to leakage current sensor and remote controller respectively. This can be used for data processing and storage of data.},

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is, undoubtedly, one of the most promising and potentially disruptive technologies of the Industry 4.0 era, able to transform the traditional manufacturing paradigm and fuel the generally accepted and necessary shift towards the conceptualisation, design and adoption of sustainable and circular business models. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the structure of the scientific field residing in the intersection of AM and Circular Economy (CE), by determining the status of its current state-of-the-art, proposing an initial typology in an attempt to contribute to the existing efforts of structuring this rather novice research area and pinpointing research gaps where more focus should be put, and highlighting areas with a significant potential for added-value future research. To that end, a sample of 206 papers, published from 2014 to 2020, was retrieved from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After studying and critically evaluating their content in full, contributions were classified into six thematic categories, providing a first typology of the current literature, followed by a detailed section highlighting and taxonomizing existing review studies. Next, contributions of the three categories of interest are discussed followed by a critical evaluation of the study’s contribution, inherent limitations and future research potential.},

	abstract = {Conductive yarns have emerged as a viable alternative to metallic wires in e-Textile devices, such as antennas, inductors, interconnects, and more, which are integral components of smart clothing applications. But the parasitic capacitance induced by their micro-structure has not been fully understood. This capacitance greatly affects device performance in high-frequency applications. We propose a lump-sum and turn-to-turn model of an air-core helical inductor constructed from conductive yarns, and systematically analyze and quantify the parasitic elements of conductive yarns. Using three commercial conductive yarns as examples, we compare the frequency response of copper-based and yarn-based inductors with identical structures to extract the parasitic capacitance. Our measurements show that the unit-length parasitic capacitance of commercial conductive yarns ranges from 1 fF/cm to 3 fF/cm, depending on the yarn’s microstructure. These measurements offer significant quantitative estimation of conductive yarn parasitic elements and provide valuable design and characterization guidelines for e-Textile devices.},

	abstract = {The recent advancement of science and technology in the world market has increased the demand for smart materials for various electronic device applications. The intrinsic challenges present in traditional manufacturing technologies in development of smart materials has enhanced the need to implement additive manufacturing techniques i.e.,3D printing (3DP) in electronic devices. The various 3DP techniques provide the designing freedom, innovation strategy, and minimization in waste with the capability to fabricate complex structures with rapid prototyping. The 3D printed structures have the tendency to overcome the challenges associated with their application in batteries, super capacitors, sensors and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) with excellent properties and output characteristics. The emergence of mechanical harvesting-based devices using 3DP has enhanced its versatility. The combination of burgeoning 3DP technology with advanced electronic devices has favoured the emergence of cutting-edge portable electronics with exceptional energy storage and internet of things. In this paper, an inclusive review of various 3DP techniques involved in electronic device application is carried out and the challenges involved in it have been addressed. The review focusses on the technical aspects of different 3DP techniques and their imperative role in manufacturing meticulous 3D printed structures for electronic devices. This paper also provides a summary of 3DP, as well as an assessment of its advantages and disadvantages, as a standard for future research and development in manufacturing cost-effective smart devices for industrial applications.},

	abstract = {Approximate formulas have been developed for the impedance, efficiency, and Q of electrically small, ferrite-loaded loop antennas. The formulas are based on an assumed knowledge of these parameters for the antenna without ferrite loading. One set of formulas is based on an assumed internal magnetic field, i.e., the field in the ferrite. It is primarily applicable to ellipsoidal-shaped cores. Another set of formulas is based on assumed internal and external fields. It is primarily applicable to rod-shaped cores. The formulas are derived by using the reaction concept, which makes the result relatively insensitive to the assumed distribution. The results are used to evaluate the effect of ferrite size and shape. The results of a variety of measurements are given for comparison.},
