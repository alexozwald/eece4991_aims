	abstract = {This article presents a miniature ultrawideband active magnetic probe which is composed of a passive structure and an active amplification circuit structure. The active circuit mainly contains two chips, specifically an amplification chip (HMC797APM5E) and a power management chip (HMC980LP4E). The maximum size of the probe is no more than 64 × 41.5 mm2. Compared with the passive probe with the same-sized loop, the sensitivity of the proposed probe is enhanced by 25 dB through the active circuit design. The working frequency bandwidth of the proposed probe can cover 9 kHz to 18 GHz. Additionally, the flatness is about ±4 dB in terms of {\textbar}S21{\textbar} in the stable working bandwidth. It is efficient for high-frequency near-field scanning.},

PD is an early stage of fault occurs before major breakdown may due to electrical insulation failure, natural disaster and mis-operation. The electromagnetic (EM) signal radiated from PD event was measured and analyse over a range of frequency 300 MHz – 3 GHz. A circular and square loop antennas were modeled using CST Microwave Studio software based on the PD’s characteristics. The loop antenna parameters such as circumference, radius and end to end gap were varied accordingly to assess the effect of return loss and radiation pattern. The results revealed that the circular loop antenna had the greatest influence towards PD detection.},

	abstract = {For the first time, a planar and low-profile magnetic loop antenna is proposed for designing an omnidirectional metalmountable radio frequency identification (RFID) tag antenna. The proposed tag antenna, which consists of an annular slot exciter, a shorted patch, two shorting stubs, and four notches, can be easily made on one side of a flexible polyimide film. It has a dimension of 38 mm × 38 mm × 1.6 mm (0.116λ x 0.116λ x 0.0049λ). The tag antenna is able to generate stable omnidirectional read patterns when placed on metal. The notches are not only employed for bringing down the tag's resonant frequency to the ultrahigh (UHF) RFID band, but they can also be used for effectively reducing the gain fluctuation in the azimuth plane. Good maximum power transmission of 90\% is attainable. Measurements are conducted with reference to a transmitting power of 4W EIRP, and it has been shown that the proposed tag antenna is able to generate omnidirectional radiation patterns with a stable read distance of 5.29-5.65 m on metal in all directions in the azimuth plane. The tag's resonant frequency is also very stable with a maximum fluctuation of only 0.22\%.},

On the other hand, the rapidly changing magnetic field induces current on the conducting silver particles, resulting in a negative polarizability. The macroscopic magnetic susceptivities are negative under the long-wavelength limit.

But the parasitic capacitance induced by their micro-structure has not been fully understood. This capacitance greatly affects device performance in high-frequency applications. We propose a lump-sum and turn-to-turn model of an air-core helical inductor constructed from conductive yarns, and systematically analyze and quantify the parasitic elements of conductive yarns. Using three commercial conductive yarns as examples, we compare the frequency response of copper-based and yarn-based inductors with identical structures to extract the parasitic capacitance. Our measurements show that the unit-length parasitic capacitance of commercial conductive yarns ranges from 1 fF/cm to 3 fF/cm, depending on the yarn’s microstructure. These measurements offer significant quantitative estimation of conductive yarn parasitic elements and provide valuable design and characterization guidelines for e-Textile devices.},
